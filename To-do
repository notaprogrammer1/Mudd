To do:
  add Experience system:
  
  
    def levelUp():
    global playerHealth
    global maxHealth
    global playerLevel
    maxHealth += 10
    playerHealth = maxHealth
    print("Your experiences in this world make you stronger.")

        levelUp()
        
    Add currentExp and playerLevel variables
      inside of playerAttack():
