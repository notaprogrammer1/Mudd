To do:
#  add Experience system:
#  add Class system
#  add Class abilities

debug needed:
  Can skewer enemy and leave, but:
          File "game.py", line 391, in subWait
          locations[loc]["enemies"].remove(i)
      ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
   Also, when you skewer an enemy and leave, they still attack you lol
